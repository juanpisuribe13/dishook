# Dishook
Are you tired of setting up a lot of stuff you don't even know about just to mess up with Discord's webhook? 
Well, now you don't need to worry about that.

Dishook can send discord messages thru webhook on a terminal as a command! Just give it the webhook link, 
the message you wish and profit!

It saves you a lot of time. Instead of downloading a programming language, installing the correct libraries, 
copying and pasting code, then trying to fix it, you could just use this instead.

For the nerds: This is written in Golang. Installer is written in Python.
