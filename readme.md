# Dishook (Alpha)
Dishook is an universal CLI Discord webhook manager (or executer) written in Golang. It's fast and very efficient.

It saves you a lot of time - instead of downloading a programming language, installing the correct libraries, 
copying and pasting code, then trying to fix it, you could run a simple command to avoid wasting a huge amount of time.

## Manual Installation

**1.** Go to the repository's [latest release](https://github.com/juanpisuribe13/Dishook/releases/latest).

**2.** Download the executable. If you have a hard time telling which one is for your operating system, 
.exe is for Windows and the one without a file type is Linux.

**3.** Move the executable to your operating system's PATH. For Windows, it is C:\Windows. For Linux, /usr/bin.

However, if you're on Windows and you don't feel comfortable moving it to your system folder, open cmd, run `set PATH` and 
pick which folder you're comfortable putting it on.

**4.** Done!

# FAQ

### Dishook is an invalid command, what do I do?

Check if dishook is already in your system's path. If it is, open a new command line window and try again.

### How do I use this?

Open a new command-line window, and type in `dishook -h` to get started.

### As any other CLI app, will arguments/flags be implemented?

Yep! If you wanna know which arguments/flags will be implemented, refer to Projects.

### There's a lot of names out there and you choosed Dishook, even if there's a lot of projects with that name. Why?

Because this name fits perfectly for a command-line argument. Typing `discordwebhook` takes a lot of
time and looks weird. Also, typing in an original but complicated name is hard to remember.
My point is, Dishook is easily rememerable and takes less time to write.
